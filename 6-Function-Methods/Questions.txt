//// Function to find sum of two numbers
//// Function to swap two values of variables
//// Function To Find Product of two numbers
//// Function to Find Factorial of number
//// Function to Find Binomial Coefficient
//// Binomial Coefficient = (n!)/(r!)*(n-r)!
//// What is functions Overloading
//// For Ex. To Check if a number is Prime or not
//// For Ex. Print all Primes in a Range
//// For Ex. Convert From Binary to Decimal
///// For Ex. Convert From Decimal to Binary
///// Question 1 : Write a Java method to compute the average of three numbers..
//// Question 2 : Write a method named isEven that accepts an int argument. The
//// method
//// should return true if the argument is even, or false otherwise. Also write
//// a program to test your
//// method.
//// Question 3 : Write a Java program to check if a number is a palindrome in Java? ( 121 is a
//// palindrome, 321 is not)
//// A number is called a palindrome if the number is equal to the reverse of a number e.g., 121 is a
//// palindrome because the reverse of 121 is 121 itself. On the other hand, 321 is not a
//// palindrome because the reverse of 321 is 123, which is not equal to 321.
Write a Java method to compute the sum of the digits in an integer.
(Hint : Approach this question in the following way :
a. Take a variable sum = 0
b. Find the last digit of the number
c. Add it to the sum
d. Repeat a & b until the number becomes 0
